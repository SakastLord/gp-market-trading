Genetric Programming Market Trading (GP)

This projects aim is to find trading rules using genetic programming (GP)
based on previous prices, volumes etc. and aditional basic tehnical trading
analysis functions. Generetad program in AST returns either true or false, true
meaning "signal to buy" or to "hold on" if already bought, and false to sell
if already bought or "not to buy". The value of the root of the tree can only
be true or folse (logical funcion, logical constant) and storngly typed
genetic programming is used (STGP). Implementation is using OpenBEAGLE a
versatile framework for genetic programming
